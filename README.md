#What Is a Kernel, and What Does It Do? 

The kernel is the special piece of the operating system that controls the CPU hardware, allocates memory, accesses data, schedules processes, runs the applications, and protects them from each other. It is the first program loaded on the computer when the computer starts up. The most critical pieces of code in the kernel are loaded into protected areas of memory so that they can't be overwritten by other applications running in the operating system. 

Since then, thousands of developers from around the world have contributed to enhancing the Linux kernel as well as the many pieces of software that make up the many different Linux distributions. Those developers include volunteers as well as developers from commercial companies. Today, the nonprofit Linux Foundation helps to create standards, awareness, and advancements across many different Linux projects.
